## Issue 1: Add test coverage reporting

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `ci`  
**Priority:** Medium

### Description

Implement test coverage reporting to provide visibility into what code is covered by tests and what isn't.

### Proposed Solution

- Use `kcov` or similar tool for bash script coverage
- Generate coverage reports for each test run
- Add coverage percentage to test summary
- Upload coverage reports to Codecov or similar service
- Add coverage badge to README

### Benefits

- Identify untested code paths
- Set coverage goals and track progress
- Prevent coverage regression
- Build confidence in test suite

### Implementation Ideas

```bash
# Example using kcov
kcov --exclude-pattern=/usr coverage/ ./run_tests.sh

# Coverage badge in README
![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/erankavija/universal_bookmark/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)
```

## Issue 2: Implement parallel test execution

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `performance`  
**Priority:** Low

### Description

Currently, all test suites run sequentially. Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback, especially in CI.

### Proposed Solution

- Implement `--parallel` flag in `run_tests.sh`
- Use GNU parallel or background jobs to run test suites simultaneously
- Ensure test isolation (already using separate temp dirs)
- Collect and aggregate results from parallel runs
- Handle output synchronization to avoid garbled logs

### Implementation Ideas

```bash
# Using GNU parallel
parallel --jobs 4 --tag ::: ./test_bookmarks.sh ./test_frecency.sh ...

# Or using background jobs
for test in test_*.sh; do
    ./"$test" > "$test.log" 2>&1 &
done
wait
```

### Considerations

- Test suites must be completely isolated (already are)
- May be harder to debug failures
- Need to aggregate results from multiple runs
- Some developers may not have GNU parallel installed

### Expected Improvement

Reduce test execution time by 60-70% (from ~30s to ~10s)

## Issue 3: Optimize CI with caching

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ci`, `performance`  
**Priority:** High

### Description

The CI workflow installs dependencies every time. Implement caching to speed up CI runs.

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Cache fzf installation

```yaml
- name: Cache fzf
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.fzf
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-fzf-${{ hashFiles('**/*.sh') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-fzf-
```

#### 2. Cache apt packages

```yaml
- name: Cache apt packages
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: /var/cache/apt
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-apt
```

#### 3. Optimize checkout

Use shallow clone:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 1
```

### Expected Benefits

- Reduce CI run time by 30-50%
- Faster feedback on pull requests
- Reduced GitHub Actions minutes usage

## Issue 4: Enhance test output formatting

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `dx`  
**Priority:** Low

### Description

Improve test output to make it easier to scan results and identify failures quickly.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1. Add test timing information
- Show duration for individual tests
- Highlight slow tests (>1s)

#### 2. Improve failure output
- Show context around failures
- Diff expected vs actual for failed assertions
- Add "quick fix" suggestions

#### 3. Add progress indicators
- Show test progress (Test 5/25)
- Add spinner for long-running tests

#### 4. Generate test report files
- JUnit XML format for CI integration
- HTML reports for human viewing
- JSON format for tooling

### Example Output

```
Running test: Add URL bookmark [1/25]
✓ Add URL bookmark (0.3s)

Running test: Complex query test [15/25]
✓ Complex query test (1.2s) ⚠ SLOW

Running test: Invalid input handling [20/25]
✗ Invalid input handling (0.1s)
  Expected: exit code 1
  Actual:   exit code 0
  Hint: Check input validation in add_bookmark()
```

## Issue 5: Add pre-commit hooks for testing

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `dx`  
**Priority:** Medium

### Description

Add git hooks to run relevant tests before commits to catch issues early.

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Create `.githooks/pre-commit`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run tests on changed files only
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep "\.sh$")
if [ -n "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
    ./run_tests.sh -f  # Fail-fast mode
fi
```

#### 2. Setup script integration

- Update `setup.sh` to install git hooks
- Add option to skip hook installation

#### 3. Fast mode for hooks

- Only run tests related to changed files
- Skip slow integration tests
- Add `--hook` mode to `run_tests.sh`

### Configuration Example

```bash
# In setup.sh
read -p "Install git hooks for automatic testing? [y/N] " response
if [[ $response =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    git config core.hooksPath .githooks
fi
```

### Benefits

- Catch test failures before pushing
- Encourage test-driven development
- Reduce CI failures
- Faster development feedback

## Issue 6: Improve test documentation

**Labels:** `documentation`, `testing`  
**Priority:** Medium

### Description

Enhance documentation around testing to help contributors write and run tests effectively.

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Create `TESTING.md`

- How to run tests
- How to write new tests
- Testing best practices
- Troubleshooting test failures

#### 2. Add inline documentation

- Document test framework functions
- Add examples to test files
- Explain test patterns

#### 3. Update README

- Add CI status badge
- Add test coverage badge (when implemented)
- Expand testing section
- Link to detailed testing guide

#### 4. Create test templates

- Template for new test files
- Template for test cases
- Examples of good tests

### Example Structure

```markdown
# Testing Guide

## Quick Start
./run_tests.sh

## Writing Tests
1. Create new test file: test_myfeature.sh
2. Source test framework
3. Implement run_test_suite()
4. Add tests using run_test()

## Test Patterns
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases (empty input, special chars)
- Clean up test artifacts
```

## Issue 7: Add cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL)

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `ci`, `cross-platform`  
**Priority:** Medium

### Description

Ensure tests pass on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, WSL) by adding matrix testing to CI.

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Update CI workflow

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

#### 2. Handle platform differences

- Date command differences
- Sed/awk variations
- Path separators
- Default shell differences

#### 3. Platform-specific tests

- Test file type execution on each platform
- Test URL opening on each platform
- Test editor integration

#### 4. Document platform support

- List supported platforms
- Note any platform-specific limitations
- Provide troubleshooting for each platform

### Expected Challenges

- Windows/WSL bash differences
- macOS command variations (BSD vs GNU)
- Different default shells
- Path handling differences

## Issue 8: Add performance regression testing

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `testing`, `performance`  
**Priority:** Low

### Description

Add tests to ensure performance doesn't regress as features are added.

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Benchmark key operations

```bash
benchmark_add_operation() {
    start=$(date +%s%N)
    ./bookmarks.sh add "Test" url "http://example.com"
    end=$(date +%s%N)
    duration=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
    
    if [ $duration -gt 100 ]; then
        echo "Warning: Add operation took ${duration}ms (threshold: 100ms)"
    fi
}
```

#### 2. Test with large datasets

- Create bookmarks file with 1000+ entries
- Measure search performance
- Test list/display performance
- Verify frecency calculation speed

#### 3. Track performance over time

- Store benchmark results
- Compare against baseline
- Alert on significant regression (>20% slower)

#### 4. Add performance tests to CI

- Run on every PR
- Only fail on major regression
- Track trends over time

### Key Operations to Benchmark

- Add bookmark (target: <100ms)
- Search all bookmarks (target: <200ms)
- List bookmarks (target: <50ms)
- Frecency calculation (target: <10ms per bookmark)
